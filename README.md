## Minesweepers Platform
### 2014 Story 
In 2014 i worked to create a Minesweeping Robot for @landminefreeorg competition .  The competition rules at that time were ther robot must find 11 metal cubes "mines" in a 19 M by 19 M arena within 20 minutes. The robot must also provid a map with the location of the mines in the arena. I designed the Robot from A to Z staring with Robot Chassis ended up with software architecture and mapping . The project was divided into four clear portions: robot **movement**, **navigation** and **mapping**, **metal detection**, **electrical system** and **mechanical system**.
All related files, codes, design and components can be found at this repository.

# Minesweepers Platform as an opensource 

#####  In 2015 and 2016 I recruited a new team from 1st level students and started to train them as well sharing with them the source code and the robot materials, fast forward we decided to document and relais the work around 4 years that will help the community and developers to creat their own robotics paltforms and applications
